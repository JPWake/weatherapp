Final Project for WEB.125.0002

For the Final Project, I am tasked to create a weather app in Vue using the OpenWeather API to display weather conditions for the current day and next 4 days. Project includes a Chart.js visualization that displays temperature and rainfall amounts in a bar or line chart.
